        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="lead dropcap">
          Martins Station is a family farmstead and healing space, rooted in craft, care, and creativity.
          Named for our kin—and for a beloved sister whose spirit guides us—we grow food, make goods, share art,
          and offer bodywork in the little valley we call home.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Farm-to-table here means soil first. We compost, save seed, harvest with the seasons, and cook what the
          garden gives. In the studio we pour beeswax, carve and paint, and turn windfalls and wild color into
          small-batch pieces that feel good to hold. In the treatment room, gentle, intuitive bodywork helps people
          rest, release, and return to themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Every offering is hand-made and small-scale—grown or crafted slowly, with gratitude for this place and the
          people we serve.
